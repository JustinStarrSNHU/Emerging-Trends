## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

- Computer scientists work to provide solutions to complex problems. This matters because it often means that computer scientists are at the forefront of advancing computer technologies, which includes developing software applications, systems, and algorithms. Oftentimes, Computer Scientists work in collaborative environments, sharing as much information with each other as possible, which helps them accomplish goals quickly and more accurately. This leads to better product development, as well as identifying and fixing problems as they arise. 

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

- As a computer scientist, I approach problems by first having an understanding of what the problem is and what resources might be needed to solve the problem. Once I have gathered enough information, I use problem-solving skills to find an appropriate solution based on the specific requirements of the problem. 

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

- I believe I have an ethical responsibility to both the end user and organizations. It is essential that while developing software I am transparent to users about how their information or data is collected and what it will be used for and that this data is kept secure to the best of my ability. I also believe that I have the responsibility to create software or systems that are not harmful and are inclusive, meaning that they do not discriminate against any particular group or individual. The end user's privacy is a fundamental right and should always be regarded as such, ensuring appropriate measures are taken to protect users' privacy. As it concerns the organization, I believe I have an ethical responsibility to produce software that works as intended while maintaining the ethical responsibilities to the end user. Similar to the responsibilities of the end user, I also have a responsibility to the organization to protect their data, not to misuse any information that I may be privy to unless this information could cause harm, and I must not create software that could be damaging to the organization.
